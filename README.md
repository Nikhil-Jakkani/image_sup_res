# image_sup_res
super resolution is a process of recovering high resolution images from low resolution images. • High resolution image offers a high pixel density and thereby more details about the original 
scene. • The need for higher resolution is common in computer vision applications for better performance 
in pattern
• recognition and analysis of images. • The super resolution has many real world applications, including medical imaging, satellite 
imaging, • surveillance and security, and astronomical imaging. • For instance, in a camera surveillance system, sometimes it is hard to recognize a person due to 
the
• low resolution of the human face. • In recent years, several models based on deep neural networks have achieved great success in 
both computational • performance and accuracy of the reconstructed super resolution images.
NOTE : The efficient Subpixel convolutional neural network is a new super resolution approach and will be used
